This is because everything changes, specially the way our life is organized, everyone has their everyday locations like schools, shops, restaurants, etc. People often searches for places similar to their previous ones so it is easier to adapt, that is why it is useful to have an idea where to look so you can find you new home easily, even if you want a complete change in your lifestyle, knowing the structure of a country or state is important."
