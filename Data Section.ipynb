These two datasets, however, lack data for certain years. For example, the player stats dataset ends in 2017, and the player draft dataset starts in 1978 and ends in 2015. To complement\nthese two datasets, I scraped basketball-reference.com for player season stats of 2018 and player draft positions of 1965-1977 and 2016-2017 (players drafted in 2018 has yet to play in NBA)."
